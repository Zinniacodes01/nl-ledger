# Data sources

Notes on each source NL Ledger uses or has looked at: where it lives, what it holds, and its quirks. Checked 2026-09-30. "Verified" means the page or file was fetched; "untested" means it came from search results or was blocked.

## Access notes

- open.canada.ca, gov.nl.ca and MERX reject curl's default user agent. A browser user agent works.
- Federal bulk CSVs redirect to an Azure blob URL (`curl -L`) and start with a byte-order mark.
- The federal datastore has no full-text search on tables over 100K rows and no `datastore_search_sql`. Only exact-match `filters` work. The site loads the bulk files into its own database.
- **Federal contracts and grants repeat the whole record on every amendment.** Contracts are grouped by procurement id and cleaned vendor name across departments, latest row kept; source-reviewed supplier-name changes join only with matching department, procurement, original start and value. Earlier printings stay as provenance; grants by (department, agreement number, recipient), latest amendment kept or amendments summed depending on how the department reports. Address-selected contracts: $11.9B as published, CAD 2,547,127,660.51 after grouping. An address selects a record; it does not locate work, benefits or spending. Location evidence and conflicts are preserved separately. Current figures are in `reconciliation.md`.
- opendata.gov.nl.ca has no API. Its 76 datasets mirror on open.canada.ca CKAN under organization `nl-tnl`. Most are from 2013-2017.

## Federal evidence and money rule (30 September 2026)

An address selects a record; it does not establish work, benefit or expenditure location. Every federal record keeps the selection field and locator, reported country/province/postal code/city, full bilingual delivery/comments/project narratives/coverage/expected results, separately cited geographic evidence and a conflict state. Programme purpose remains available as context; unreviewed prose stays unknown. Exact reviewed project decisions are guarded against changed source evidence in `pipeline/federal_location_reviews.json`.

CanadaBuys rejects known foreign countries and validates Canadian postal codes. Public Accounts professional-services selection tests the trailing place, not the company name; published NL abbreviations are accepted. Contradictory grant locations stay visible. Native amounts and currencies remain as published: foreign and unstated currencies are not converted, and missing amounts differ from zero. Published notice total zero stays zero; only an absent total uses the contract-amount fallback.

Supplier commitment summaries exclude Public Accounts payments and CanadaBuys notices by overlap policy, not by a proven record-level duplicate. Source/body summaries show notices separately; retained combined body values explicitly disclose overlap. Major transfers are separate geographically identified receipt context, not provincial expenditure or additional unique records. Federal records and mixed supplier summaries have no automatic provincial scaling. [Every moved total](federal-total-changes.csv); [source review and verification](federal-evidence-review.md).
