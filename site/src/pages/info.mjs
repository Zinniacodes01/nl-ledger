    <li>The receipt treats your income as employment income from one job. The enhanced CPP and CPP2 contributions are deducted from it to get net income, which the brackets and the low-income reduction then use.</li>

Enhanced CPP is ${(S.nl_tax.cpp.enhanced_rate * 100).toFixed(0)}% of the same earnings, and CPP2 is ${(S.nl_tax.cpp.cpp2_rate * 100).toFixed(0)}% of earnings from ${money(S.nl_tax.cpp.ympe)} to ${money(S.nl_tax.cpp.yampe)}.

    <li>Other credits (pension, age, tuition, dependants) are not applied, so the receipt overstates tax somewhat for anyone who has them.</li>

Most departments follow it, and several say so in their notes: the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ("the previous value was $X", which matches the row before), Health Canada ("The total agreement value previously disclosed has been updated"), the National Research Council ("The total amended value is"), Innovation, Science and Economic Development ("value changed from X to Y"). For these the latest amendment is the agreement's value.</p>
  <p>Four departments report each amendment as the change in value instead. For these every row of the agreement is added up.</p>

Indigenous Services and Crown-Indigenous Relations paid more in those four years than their latest rows add up to for every year on file, so those rows cannot be agreement totals. If Canadian Heritage and the Public Health Agency were read as reporting totals, the grants total would be ${moneyWords(["pch", "phac-aspc"].reduce((t, o) => t + F.grants.change_reporting[o].summed - F.grants.change_reporting[o].latest_only, 0))} lower.</p>
  <h3>Grouping rows into agreements</h3>
  <ol><li>Rows are grouped by department, agreement number and recipient. Spelling, punctuation and legal suffixes in the recipient's name are ignored, and "English name|French name" is the same recipient as the English name alone.</li>
  <li>A recipient renamed on an amendment (a new legal name, a transfer to a successor) stays in the same agreement. Rows under another name with a different program and start date are a different agreement that shares the number.</li>
  <li>Rows with no agreement number are one agreement each, except where a department reports an amendment under a new reference number (Infrastructure Canada, Veterans Affairs): those join on recipient, start date, program and title.</li></ol>
  <p>As published: ${num(F.grants.raw_rows)} rows, ${money(F.grants.raw_value)}. Counted once: ${num(F.grants.agreements)} agreements, ${money(F.grants.dedup_value)}. The code is <a href="${REPO}/blob/main/pipeline/parse_federal.py">parse_federal.py</a>.</p>
  <h2>CanadaBuys award notices</h2><p>Grouped by reference number and supplier, latest amendment kept. The same contract can appear here and in the contracts disclosure. Notices are excluded from supplier commitment summaries and shown separately in source and body summaries. Any retained combined body amount is an overlapping record-value sum, not spending. Foreign and unstated currency never enter CAD totals.</p>

<section class="section"><div class="wrap prose">
  <p>A supplier page represents the organisation the publisher named, not a verified tax registrant. Conflicting business numbers alone do not split a page. A split also needs disjoint postal-code or locality evidence, or a named source identifying different organisations. Overlapping location sets and missing addresses do not establish disagreement. Every later join checks the same evidence across both whole groups.</p>
  <p>Joined records retain every published business number; conflicts are listed on the supplier page. Where a printed name still has several pieces, each page links the others with their own included and excluded totals and says when identity is unresolved. One piece is not the organisation's whole record.</p>
  <h2>When names are joined</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Split evidence.</strong> Conflicting numbers split a printed name when its location evidence also disagrees or a named source identifies different organisations. An unnumbered record joins a piece only when its location identifies that piece uniquely; otherwise it remains unresolved.</li>
    <li><strong>Same name.</strong> Case, accents, apostrophes, punctuation, spacing and legal suffixes (Inc., Ltd., Limited, Corp., Ltée) are set aside, and NL and Nfld are read as the province's name. Anything after "o/a", "c/o" or "formerly" is dropped: the record belongs to the legal name before it.</li>
    <li><strong>Bilingual.</strong> Federal grant records print a recipient as "English name|French name". Both halves are the same recipient.</li>
    <li><strong>Business number.</strong> Federal grant records with the same valid business number are joined when the names are a spelling slip apart, or one name is inside the other and adds only words such as Inc., Association or Council. Department placeholders (000000000, 1000xxxxx) fail the number's check digit and are ignored. Full charity accounts are kept as evidence: a church or club can hold one for each branch, but an account conflict still needs location or named-source evidence to split a page.</li>
    <li><strong>Postal code.</strong> Federal records with the same postal code are joined when the names are a spelling slip apart with the same initials, subject to the location and named-source conflict guard.</li>
    <li><strong>Same award.</strong> A federal contract and a CanadaBuys notice with the same award date and the same value to the cent are one award, so their close names are one supplier.</li>
    <li><strong>Department or campus.</strong> A department, faculty or campus printed after its body's name ("Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, Department of Education") is part of that body.</li>
    <li><strong>Reviewed.</strong> A short list of decisions, each with its reason, for matches the rules above cannot make: a renamed body, a misprint in a provincial report, a trading name.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>When names are kept apart</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Close names with no evidence. Two different companies shown as one is worse than one company shown twice.</li>
    <li>Operating names. "Cavendish Hotel LP o/a Sheraton" is not joined to other Sheraton records: franchise names are shared by different owners.</li>
    <li>A company and its limited partnership, and a parent and its subsidiary, unless a reviewed decision gives the reason.</li>
    <li>A French name printed with more than one English name, or a placeholder such as N/A.</li>
    <li>Names that share a business number but not a name: a parent body's number can cover separate branches.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Totals</h2><p>${esc(FEDERAL_RULE)} Only supported CAD amounts enter CAD totals. Native currency, missing-value coverage, source, amount kind, periods and separately evidenced location remain in the breakdown. No mixed supplier total gets provincial scaling.</p>
  <p>A supplier's total is the sum of included record values across all years, whichever name they were printed under. Award and contract values are commitments, grant agreement values can span several years, and payments are amounts reported as paid. Sources can overlap, so this is not a deduplicated spending total. Public Accounts payment lines and CanadaBuys notices are listed separately and excluded because these sources can overlap contracts and grants; that policy does not establish that an individual record is a duplicate.</p>
  <h2>The numbers</h2>
  <p>${num(M.name_keys)} distinct names become ${num(M.suppliers)} suppliers: ${num(M.folded)} names are joined to another on the evidence above. ${num(M.near)} close names are kept apart.</p>
  ${schedule({ compact: true, caption: "Largest suppliers that combine several names", cols: [{ label: "Supplier" }, { label: "Names", num: true }, { label: "Records", num: true }, { label: "Value", num: true }], rows: M.largest.map((g) => ({ cells: [esc(g.name), num(g.names), num(g.records), moneyWords(g.value)] })) })}

  <h2>Every match, and how to question one</h2>
  <p>Every joined name, with the evidence that joined it, is in <a href="${GH}/blob/main/docs/supplier-merges.csv">supplier-merges.csv</a>; close names kept apart are in <a href="${GH}/blob/main/docs/supplier-near-matches.csv">supplier-near-matches.csv</a>, and the reviewed decisions in <a href="${GH}/blob/main/pipeline/supplier_rules.csv">supplier_rules.csv</a>.

  <h2>Log</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>30 September 2026. Federal record values and location claims corrected.</strong> Contracts: CAD 2,614,227,060.51 corrected to CAD 2,547,127,660.51, down CAD 67,099,400. The Health Canada national-service contract appeared twice under two supplier names in one amendment history. Professional-services payments: CAD 690,028,445 corrected to CAD 683,854,665, down CAD 6,173,780: two Ontario payees (CAD 6,286,216) are removed and one valid published NL abbreviation (CAD 112,436) is included. CanadaBuys: the former dollar-labelled numeric sum of 855,968,652.83 is replaced by supported CAD 830,019,361.38, a numeric reduction of 25,949,291.45. Three foreign supplier addresses are removed (EUR 52,924.80 and two zeros); USD 473,000 and 394,250 with unstated currency stay in separate native-currency summaries; six published zero notice totals no longer take fallback amounts totalling CAD 25,029,116.65. Missing and zero values remain distinct. Federal grants stay CAD 8,430,775,591.69, with conflicting Winnipeg/Regina addresses labelled. Federal records no longer get provincial per-person or wage-time figures. An address selects a record; it does not establish work, benefit or spending in NL. Home ranks sources separately and the scale page no longer adds examples together. Provincial actual-spending figures are unchanged. <a href="${GH}/blob/main/docs/federal-evidence-review.md">Sources, verification and every changed total</a>; <a href="/method/federal/">method</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>30 September 2026. Provincial award values: $1,358,312,018.08 corrected to $1,372,054,508.65, an increase of $13,742,490.57.</strong> Five entries with different products, zones, dates or terms had been removed as repeats; they are restored. Four repeated awards with punctuation or PO-label differences in their full identifiers are counted once. An explicitly corrected Hatch description replaces its earlier printing at the same value. Every counted-once award keeps the other printings and receipts. <a href="${GH}/blob/main/docs/award-review.md">Source review and every changed total</a>; <a href="/sources/#report-card">publisher report card</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>29 September 2026. Federal grants: $8.51 billion corrected to $8.43 billion.</strong> Canadian Heritage and the Public Health Agency of Canada report each amendment as the change in value, and only their latest amendment had been counted; their amendments are now added up. Some agreements were counted twice: a recipient renamed on an amendment, and Infrastructure Canada agreements with no agreement number reported again under a new reference number. The method page now shows each department's evidence and a check against Public Accounts. <a href="/method/federal/">Method</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>29 September 2026. Federal grants: $8.67 billion corrected to $8.51 billion.</strong> Some grant agreements were counted twice. A department that reports each amendment as the agreement's new total sometimes printed the recipient's name in English only and sometimes as "English name|French name", and those rows were treated as two agreements. They are now one agreement, counted at its latest amendment (for example, an Association for New Canadians agreement reported twelve times). <a href="/method/federal/">Method</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>29 September 2026. Supplier pages combine names printed different ways.</strong> A supplier's page now includes records printed under other spellings of its name where the records show they are one supplier, so its total can be higher than before. <a href="/method/suppliers/">Method</a>.</li>

  out.push(["/about/", {
    title: "What is NL Ledger?",
    description: desc("NL Ledger is an independent project, in beta, that gathers Newfoundland and Labrador public spending records in one searchable place, each linked to its source."),
    body: html`${pagehead({ crumbs: [["/", "Home"], [null, "What is this?"]], title: "What is this?", lede: `${SITE.name} is a thought experiment: what could an ordinary citizen learn about Newfoundland and Labrador public spending from the records governments already publish?` })}
<section class="section"><div class="wrap prose">
  <p>Governments publish a great deal of spending data, but it is scattered across hundreds of PDFs, spreadsheets and web pages that few people have time to read. It gathers ${num(R.itemCount)} of those records in one place and tries to make the amounts easier to picture. It gathers provincial contract awards, minister and MHA expenses, public sector pay over $100,000, department and program spending, federal records selected by reported supplier or recipient location, with address conflicts labelled. An address does not establish where work, benefits or spending occurred. Whole reported values are not an NL allocation.</p>
  <h2>How far to trust the figures</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Every record comes from a published government source, and each one links back to the file and page or row it came from.</li>
    <li>The records are read, cleaned and combined by automated scripts. Reading PDFs and scanned images can introduce errors, and combining sources means deciding how to avoid counting the same money twice. Those decisions are written down on the <a href="/method/">Methods</a> page.</li>
    <li>The figures have not been independently vetted. Totals are checked against the totals the sources print, and a sample of records has been traced back to the originals, but that is not an audit.</li>
    <li>Before relying on a figure, open its source.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="built">How it was built</h2>
  <p>${SITE.name} was built with AI coding tools, which wrote most of its code and page text under human direction. No figure is produced by an AI: every number is read by code from a government record and links to that record, so any of them can be checked. The code is <a href="https://github.com/nlledger/nl-ledger">open source</a>.</p>
  <h2>What it is not</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>It is not an audit, a news report or an official publication.</li>
    <li>It makes no accusations. The patterns it shows are questions people ask about public spending, counted from the records. Each has its method written down, and none is evidence that anything wrong happened.</li>
    <li>It is not affiliated with any government, party or campaign.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
  <p>Visits are counted with Cloudflare Web Analytics, which sets no cookies and does not track individual visitors. The site has no accounts, no sign-in and no advertising.</p>
  <h3>The feedback box</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What is kept.</strong> A note sent from the box at the foot of a page is stored with the kind chosen, the text, the address of the page it was sent from, the time, which of the two checks the sender passed, and an email address only when one was typed in. The same is emailed to the people who run the site.</li>
    <li><strong>What is not kept.</strong> No network (IP) address, browser details or cookie is stored with a note. To limit one connection to ten notes a day, a one-way code made from the network address is kept in a separate list, and deleted once it is more than a day old, when the next note arrives. The address cannot be read back from the code without the site's secret key, and the list does not say which note came from it. Cloudflare, which runs the site, keeps a log of each request the site's program handles, a note or a search alike: the time, the address requested, the network address and browser details. Worker logs omit query strings, including receipt incomes, and are kept for a limited time. The text of a note is not in them. Receipt incomes are also removed from the page address stored and emailed with feedback.</li>
    <li><strong>Who sees it.</strong> The people who run the site. Notes are held in the site's database at Cloudflare and in the mailbox they are emailed to. A note is never shown on the site. A change made because of one is listed on <a href="/asked/">What people asked for</a>, in the site's words and without names.</li>
    <li><strong>The check that a person is sending it.</strong> When someone starts a note (the first letter typed, or a kind picked), the page loads Cloudflare Turnstile, which checks the browser for signs of an automated program. It is not loaded before that, and it sets no cookie on this site. What it collects is in Cloudflare's <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/turnstile-privacy-policy/" rel="noopener">Turnstile Privacy Addendum</a>. With JavaScript off it never loads; the site asks for one more press of a button instead.</li>
    <li><strong>How long.</strong> Notes are kept as a record of what was asked. To have a note or an email address removed, write to <a href="mailto:${SITE.contact}">${SITE.contact}</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Status</h2>
  <p>This is a beta. The coverage and the sources will change, and parts of it may be wrong. Mistakes that are found are listed on the <a href="/corrections/">Corrections</a> page. Data was last gathered on ${esc(fmtDate(D.gathered))}.</p>
  <h2 id="corrections">Corrections</h2>
  <p>To ask for a correction, use the <a href="#feedback">box at the foot of any page</a> or email <a href="mailto:${SITE.corrections}?subject=Correction%20request">${SITE.corrections}</a>. If you are a person or a company named in a record, say which page and what is wrong. Send the page address, what it shows and what you believe is correct, with a document if you have one.</p>
  <p>Each record links to the government document it came from. If the record here differs from that document, the error is on this site and will be fixed and logged on the <a href="/corrections/">Corrections</a> page. If the document itself is wrong, only the publisher can change it: contact the department, agency, House of Assembly, town or city named on the record.</p>

    <li>Records published by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, the House of Assembly and the Government of Canada, gathered and combined by automated scripts. The sources, their publishers and the terms each is published under are on the <a href="/sources/#licences">Sources page</a>.</li>
    <li>Not affiliated with, endorsed by or funded by any government, party or campaign.</li>

    <li>Built with AI coding tools, which wrote most of its code and page text under human direction. No figure is produced by an AI: every number is read by code from a government record and links to that record.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What the figures are, and are not</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Each figure is what a government record says, as read by the site's scripts. Where the site adds records together, the <a href="/method/">method page</a> for that figure explains how.</li>
    <li>A flag or pattern is a question about the records, not a finding. It is not evidence that anyone did anything wrong.</li>
    <li>Names appear only as the publishing body printed them, under the laws that require their publication. The site draws no conclusion about any person.</li>
    <li>Nothing on the site is legal, financial, tax or accounting advice. The tax receipt is an illustration, not a tax calculation for any real person.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>No guarantee</h2>
  <p>The site is provided as is. Government records contain errors and change after publication, and reading them automatically adds its own mistakes. ${SITE.name} makes no promise that any figure is complete, accurate or current. Before relying on a figure, check it against the government record it links to; the government's own record is the authority.</p>
  <h2>Limits of responsibility</h2>
  <p>To the extent the law allows, the people who make ${SITE.name} are not responsible for any loss or harm from using the site, from relying on its figures, or from what anyone else does with them. This includes the government files and other websites the site links to, which their owners control.</p>
  <h2>Corrections</h2>
  <p>Errors are corrected when they are reported. Send them through the note box at the foot of any page or to <a href="mailto:${SITE.corrections}">${SITE.corrections}</a>, with the page and what is wrong. The <a href="/corrections/">Corrections page</a> lists what has been changed.</p>
  <h2>Using what is here</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The site's own code is open source under the MIT licence.</li>
    <li>The records stay under the terms of the bodies that published them; the <a href="/sources/#licences">Sources page</a> sets those out. Anyone reusing a record should cite its publisher, as the site does.</li>
