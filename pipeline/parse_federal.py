"""Federal records selected by reported supplier or recipient location.

Contracts over $10K: every amendment repeats the whole record, with contract_value
holding the running total. Rows are grouped by (procurement_id, cleaned vendor)
and only the latest is kept. Rows without a procurement_id fall back to their
reference_number, so they are never merged with another contract.

Grants and contributions: one row per agreement (see grants()). The latest amendment is kept
where a department reports running totals; amendments are summed where it reports changes
(CHANGE_REPORTING).

CanadaBuys award notices overlap the contracts disclosure (the same contract can
appear in both). Notices are excluded from supplier commitment summaries and shown
separately in source/body summaries; retained combined values disclose overlap.
